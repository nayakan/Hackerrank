Let's play a game on an array! You're standing at index 0 of an n-element array named game. 
From some index i(where 0 <= i <= n), you can perform one of the following moves:

Move Backward: If cell i - 1 exists and contains a 0, you can walk back to cell i - 1.
Move Forward:
If cell i + 1 contains a zero, you can walk to cell i + 1.
If cell i + leap contains a zero, you can jump to cell i + leap.
If you're standing in cell n - 1 or the value of i + leap >= n, you can walk or jump off the end of the array and win the game.

In other words, you can move from index i to index i + 1, i - 1, or i + leap as long as the destination index is 
a cell containing a 0. If the destination index is greater than n - 1, you win the game.

Given leap and , game complete the function in the editor below so that it returns true if you can win the 
game (or false if you cannot).
