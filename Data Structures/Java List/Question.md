For this problem, we have 2 types of queries you can perform on a List:

1. Insert  at index x:
Insert
x y

2.Delete the element at index x:
Delete

Given a list, L, of n integers, perform q queries on the list. Once all queries are completed, print the 
modified list as a single line of space-separated integers.

Sample Input
